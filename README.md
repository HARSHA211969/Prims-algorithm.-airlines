Prim's algorithm
*Member - Gurusai Harsha 23bds005
This Java program uses Primâ€™s algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of an airport routes graph. It reads route data from a CSV, assigns random weights to edges, and calculates the MST from a specified starting airport. Results are printed, showing connected airports and route weights in the MST.
